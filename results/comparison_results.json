      "FAISS: High performance, open-source, local, high complexity. ChromaDB: Developer-friendly, open-source, local/server, easy setup. Pinecone: Managed service, high cost, low maintenance, high scalability.",
      "FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It solves the problem of searching for similar vectors in large datasets.",
      "ChromaDB is generally easier to set up for local development with Python, offering a simpler API. FAISS requires more manual index management but offers higher raw performance for large datasets.",
      "FAISS is superior for limited budget as it is free and open-source, whereas Pinecone is a paid managed service (though it has a free tier).",
      "ReAct (Reason+Act) interleaves reasoning traces and actions. Example: Thought: 'I need to find the author.' Action: Search('author of book'). Observation: 'John Doe'.",
      "Plan-and-Execute separates high-level planning from low-level execution, preventing the agent from getting lost in details and ensuring a more structured approach to complex tasks.",
      "Standardized protocol for connecting LLMs to external data and tools, facilitating dynamic discovery and interaction.",
      "HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World), IVF (Inverted File Index), and Flat (Brute Force).",
      "Sparse vectors (e.g., TF-IDF) have many zeros and match exact keywords. Dense vectors (e.g., via Transformers) are compact numerical representations capturing semantic meaning.",
      "ColBERT delays the interaction between query and document embeddings until the end (late interaction) enabling faster retrieval, whereas standard BERT interacts purely at the encoder level (early interaction) which is slower."
